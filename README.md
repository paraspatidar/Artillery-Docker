# Artillery-Docker

This is sample Docker file and few load testing configurations which eventually creates docker image which can be used to perform load testing based on pre-existing configuration file in image /pod.
Further we can use **persistent volumes** or **KUBECTL CP** , to put additional configuration or load files and use them.

This offloads the CPU and network restriction form local computer and via this image we can run it on any public cloud as docker container or Kubernetes pod.
